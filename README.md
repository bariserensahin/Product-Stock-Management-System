# Product-Stock-Management-System


The Product Stock Management System is a C program that reads product inventory data from a file (products.txt). 
It uses a Product structure to store details such as id, name, unit, and quantity in an array.
The program parses each line from the file, tokenizes it, and stores the data.
It handles up to 100 products and provides basic file reading and data storage functionality.
